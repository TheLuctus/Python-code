# Python-code
Some python projects I'm working on.
I'm kinda new to coding.
If you have tips for me or any suggestion on how to write nicer code, send them to me.


-Filefinder roots, opens and reads a text file of your choice from your PC.
 Only finds whole file names.
 Exsample: "ur_filename.file_extension"

-BiDeHex calculates decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal numbers and the other way around.
-Password Generator creates new random passwords.
(I'll add comments later).
