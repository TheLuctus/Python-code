# Python-code
Some python projects I'm working on.
I'm kinda new to coding.
If u have tips for me or any suggestion on how to write nicer code, send them to me.

-Filefinder roots, opens and reads text files from ur PC.
-BiDeHex calculates decimal numbers to Binary and Hexadecimal numbers and the other way around.
-Password Gen is a Password Generator.
(I'll add comments later).
